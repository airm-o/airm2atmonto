# Evaluation of matching systems on the reference alignment (EQ)

The files in this folder represent the alignments (RDF/XML) computed by popular ontology matching systems AgreementMakerLight, LogMap and YAM++. We refer to the [[GitHub page]](https://airm-o.github.io/atmonto2airm/) for a human readable presentation of the matching results.
